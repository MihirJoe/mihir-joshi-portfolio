    "about": " Hi, I'm Mihir Joshi and I am interested in medical AI, digital health, and wearable sensing in the context of early diagnostics and remote patient monitoring.\n\n I'm a 3rd year honors undergraduate student majoring in Biomedical Engineering at The Ohio State University and minoring in Computer Science. Growing up with many severe food allergies, I've developed a strong empathy towards people with serious medical conditions. It is this empathy that drives me to do research at the intersection of technology and medicine. From iOS development to machine learning to biomechanics research, I have a wide variety of skills and interests that will help me in ensuring those around me feel less burdened by their medical complications.",
